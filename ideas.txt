democracy system
- vote on different actions
- declare a substitute voter for different actions
- if substitute votes and you don't, substitute's vote is increased by 1
- player can see if there is a voting happing for them, like a ban
    - this way player can ask others to vote in their favour to avoid the action
    - other people don't see if someone has a voting happening to avoid bias
    - there needs to be a reasonable timeframe for this, so players can react
- actions:
    - baning people: 2/3 majority rule
        - timed ban or perma ban?

customization system
- players can specify art to be used in the game
- other people can see if a player has customization available and can opt it to view
- players can block other players custimization if they end up not liking them (you see player has customization but also that it's blocked by you)
- custimization are send peer to peer on demand, so no player or server is liable for distributing unsafe content
- custimization needs a checksum so we can cache it and don't have to download it each time
- maybe keep track on how many people have looked at customization vs. how many blocked it to warn other players before viewing customization
    - show a percent rating of how many people didn't like it
- similar to appearance, we want to add custom emotes to the game
    - you opt-in for emotes as well
    - you can block individual emotes, if you don't want to block all
    - cache emotes and checksums
    - easy way to copy other player emotes to use yourself
        - warn people that they become liable if they do this
        - new emotes will be free to copy after a grace period
        - people can vote for banning emotes
            - use checksum, but of course it's easy to make a minor change which makes the checksum useless
            - vote for punishing people who abuse this, maybe by taking away their emote rights?
    - emotes get assigned a string, which will be replaced if the player has them enabled (like 7TV)
